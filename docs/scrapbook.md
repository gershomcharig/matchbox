- When adding a new place, give me ability to create a new collection from the modal.
- Ability to filter by type other than by tag
- No spaces accepted in the tags format.
- Unify search and tags filter, so that searching for `#kids-friendly` will look for all the places with that tag.
- Add `price_level` or `price_range` field from API
