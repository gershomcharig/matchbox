  - Returns success/error object to client
  - Login form wired to server action with error handling
  - Incorrect password shows user-friendly error message
  - Correct password redirects to main page (session token to be added in 2.6)

## Decisions Made

### Database
- Using Supabase (PostgreSQL) with free tier
- All tables created via Supabase dashboard/SQL editor
- Foreign key from places.collection_id → collections.id
- Soft delete via deleted_at timestamp on places

### Project Structure
- /src/app - Next.js App Router pages
- /src/components - React components
- /src/lib - Utility functions (supabase.ts, etc.)
- /docs - Documentation (roadmap.md, PRD.md, progress.txt)

### Map Implementation
- Using react-map-gl v8 with subpath import: `react-map-gl/mapbox`
- Map style: mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11 (clean, minimal)
- Initial zoom level: 11

### UI/Design
- Minimal, clean aesthetic
- Empty state overlay positioned at bottom center
- Glass-morphism style card (bg-white/95 with backdrop-blur)
- Responsive breakpoint at lg (1024px) for desktop side panel

## Blockers Encountered

### 2026-01-21 - react-map-gl import issue with Turbopack
**Problem**: Build failed with "Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-map-gl'"
**Why it failed**: react-map-gl v8 uses subpath exports, no default export
**Solution**: Changed import from `react-map-gl` to `react-map-gl/mapbox`

---

## Failed Approaches

### 2026-01-21 - Default react-map-gl import
**Problem**: `import MapGL from 'react-map-gl'` failed in Turbopack
**Why it failed**: react-map-gl v8 restructured exports to use subpaths
**Better approach**: Use `import { Map } from 'react-map-gl/mapbox'` for Mapbox GL

## Learnings

### Web Crypto API for Password Hashing
- PBKDF2 is available natively in browsers and Node.js via Web Crypto API
- No need for external packages like bcrypt
- Use salt.buffer as ArrayBuffer when passing to crypto.subtle.deriveBits()
- TypeScript strict mode requires explicit type casting for ArrayBuffer

### react-map-gl v8 Breaking Changes
- v8 uses ES module subpath exports
- Import from `react-map-gl/mapbox` for Mapbox GL JS
- Import from `react-map-gl/maplibre` for MapLibre GL JS
- The Map component is named export, not default: `{ Map }`

### Next.js 16 with Turbopack
- Turbopack has stricter module resolution than Webpack
- Some npm packages may need specific import paths
- Build errors often more informative than dev server errors

---

### 2026-01-22 (Phase 14.1-14.7)
- Created: public/manifest.json (PWA manifest with share target)
- Created: public/sw.js (service worker)
- Created: public/icons/icon.svg (source icon)

- Modified: src/app/page.tsx (refreshing indicator, soft limit warning, hasActiveFilters)

---

### 2026-01-23 (Bug Fix: Trash in Mobile Panel)
- Modified: src/components/Layout.tsx
  - Added import for TrashPlacesList and getDeletedPlaces
  - Added state: showTrash (boolean), trashPlaces (PlaceWithCollection[])
  - Added handlers: handleSelectTrash, handleTrashBack, handleTrashPlacesChanged
  - Updated panel rendering to show TrashPlacesList when showTrash is true
  - Added onSelectTrash prop to CollectionsList
  - Reset trash state when closing panel via backdrop click
- Root cause: After removing SidePanel.tsx (desktop sidebar), the mobile panel lost Trash functionality because onSelectTrash was no longer being passed to CollectionsList

---

### 2026-01-23 (Bug Fix: Android Share Target Not Appearing)
- Modified: public/sw.js
  - Fixed duplicate fetch event listeners - merged into a single handler
  - Added early check for `/share` path to let share target requests pass through without caching
  - Incremented cache version from `matchbook-v1` to `matchbook-v2` to force update
- Root cause: Two issues:
  1. Android reads `share_target` from manifest only at PWA install time - existing PWA installs from before share_target was added won't see it
  2. Service worker had two fetch listeners; the first one (caching) intercepted all GET requests before the share handler could execute
- User action required: Uninstall PWA and reinstall to pick up manifest share_target config

---

### 2026-01-24 (Bug Fix: Google Maps Coordinate Extraction)
- Problem: Wrong addresses displayed when importing Google Maps links
  - Example: `https://maps.app.goo.gl/znBhk179A1MR4WtQA` showed "45 Danby Street" instead of "161 Bellenden Rd"
  - Root cause: The `/@lat,lng` regex matched the VIEWPORT/camera center, not the actual PLACE coordinates
- Solution implemented:
  - Created: src/lib/distance.ts (Haversine formula for distance calculation)
  - Modified: src/lib/maps.ts
    - Reordered coordinate extraction priority: `!3d!4d` > `?q=` > `?ll=` > `/@` > `?center=`
    - Added logic to prefer !3d!4d coords that differ from @ coords (place vs viewport)
  - Modified: src/lib/geocoding.ts
    - Added smartGeocode() function that validates coordinates against place name
    - If forward-geocoded place is >500m from extracted coords, uses forward-geocoded location instead
    - Handles all cases: both name+coords, only coords, only name, neither
  - Modified: src/components/Layout.tsx
    - Updated paste button handler and global paste listener to use smartGeocode()
    - Simplified code by removing redundant fallback logic (now handled by smartGeocode)
  - Modified: src/app/share/page.tsx
    - Updated share target handler to use smartGeocode()
- Verification: Build passes successfully

---

### 2026-01-25 (Enhancement: Google Maps Scraping with Puppeteer)
- Problem: Addresses extracted via Nominatim differ from Google Maps addresses - user wants EXACT match
- Solution: Implemented Puppeteer-based scraping to render Google Maps page and extract exact address

#### Changes Made:
- Installed: puppeteer (for headless Chrome scraping)
- Created: src/lib/google-maps-scraper.ts
  - `expandAndScrapeGoogleMapsUrl()` - expands shortened URLs and scrapes place data
  - Uses Puppeteer to render the page fully (handles JavaScript-loaded content)
  - Handles Google consent page by clicking "Accept" button
  - Extracts from DOM: name (h1), address (button[data-item-id="address"]), phone, website, hours
  - Singleton browser instance with auto-close after 60s inactivity
- Modified: src/app/actions/urls.ts
  - Added `scrapeGoogleMapsUrl()` server action for full URL scraping
  - `expandShortenedMapsUrl()` now uses Puppeteer first, falls back to fetch if it fails
  - Returns additional fields: scrapedPhone, scrapedWebsite, scrapedHours
- Modified: src/lib/geocoding.ts
  - Extended SmartGeocodeOptions with `scrapedName` and `scrapedAddress` parameters
  - smartGeocode() uses scraped address when available, skips Nominatim call
- Modified: src/components/Layout.tsx
  - Updated paste handlers to pass scraped data to smartGeocode()
- Modified: src/app/share/page.tsx
  - Updated share target handler to pass scraped data
- Created: docs/link-extractor-test-cases.json
  - Test URLs with expected exact addresses from Google

#### Tested Results (all exact matches):
- Skehans → "1 Kitto Rd, London SE14 5TW"
- Guacamoles → "48 Rye Ln, London SE15 5BY"
- Lao Dao → "305 Walworth Rd, London SE17 2TG"
- Sambal Shiok Laksa Bar → "171 Holloway Rd, London N7 8LX"

#### Notes:
- Puppeteer adds ~76 packages and requires headless Chrome
- May need additional config for Vercel deployment (@sparticuz/chromium)
- Falls back to fetch-based extraction if Puppeteer fails

---

### 2026-01-25 (Vercel Deployment Prep: Puppeteer + Cleanup)

#### Problem: Standard Puppeteer doesn't work on Vercel serverless functions
- Vercel's serverless environment doesn't have Chrome installed
- Need `@sparticuz/chromium` for serverless-compatible Chromium

#### Changes Made:

1. **Installed dependencies:**
   - `@sparticuz/chromium` - Serverless-compatible Chromium binary
   - `puppeteer-core` - Puppeteer without bundled Chromium

2. **Modified: src/lib/google-maps-scraper.ts**
   - Changed import from `puppeteer` to `puppeteer-core`
   - Added import for `@sparticuz/chromium`
   - Updated `getBrowser()` to detect production vs development:
     - Production: Uses `@sparticuz/chromium` with `chromium.args` and `chromium.executablePath()`
     - Development: Uses system Chrome with platform-specific paths (macOS, Windows, Linux)

3. **Modified: src/lib/geocoding.ts**
   - Updated file header comment to reflect new purpose (forward geocoding only)
   - Removed `reverseGeocode()` function (no longer needed - Puppeteer provides exact addresses)
   - Removed `delay()` helper (was only used for Nominatim rate limiting)
   - Updated `smartGeocode()` to remove reverseGeocode fallback
   - Removed `'reverse_geocode'` from `SmartGeocodeResult.source` type

4. **Modified: docs/prd.md**
   - Added "How Place Data Extraction Works" section documenting:
     - Puppeteer-based scraping for pasted Google Maps links
     - DOM selectors used (h1, button[data-item-id="address"], etc.)
     - Nominatim forward geocoding for manual place entry
     - Note about @sparticuz/chromium for Vercel compatibility

#### Verification:
- Build passes (`npm run build`)

---

### 2026-01-26 (Bug Fix: Google Maps Place Extraction Issues)

#### Root Cause Analysis (After Investigation)

**Android URL (`maps.app.goo.gl/SckhMyXSB3Yjn6Zz7`):**
- Redirects to consent page, continue URL: `/place/The+Gluten+Free+Bakery,+58+Chadwick+Rd,+London+SE15+4PU/data=...`
- **NO `!3d!4d` coordinates in the URL at all** - the issue wasn't wrong coords, they were missing entirely
- Address is embedded in the URL path as part of the place name
- Solution: Extract address from URL path and forward geocode to get coordinates

**Desktop URL (`maps.app.goo.gl/Bnp5Tf3mmosUFYAX6`):**
- Redirects to consent page, continue URL: `/@51.4680721,-0.0749573,17z/data=...!3d51.4680721!4d-0.0749573`
- Coordinates are correct (London: 51.46°N, 0.07°W) ✅
- Address not in URL path - would need DOM scraping, but consent page blocks this

#### Solution Implemented

**1. New URL extraction function (src/lib/maps.ts)**
- Added `extractPlaceInfoFromUrl()` to extract BOTH name AND address from URL path
- Handles Android-style URLs: `/place/Name,+Address,+City+Postcode/...`
- Returns `{ name: string, address: string | null }`

**2. Improved consent page handling (src/lib/google-maps-scraper.ts)**
- When landing on consent page, extract the `continue` URL parameter
- Navigate directly to continue URL, bypassing consent
- Falls back to parsing continue URL for data extraction if navigation fails

**3. Updated server action (src/app/actions/urls.ts)**
- Added `urlExtractedAddress` field alongside `scrapedAddress`
- When DOM scraping fails, fall back to URL path extraction
- Uses `extractPlaceInfoFromUrl()` to get address from URL

**4. Updated paste handlers (Layout.tsx, share/page.tsx)**
- Use `urlExtractedAddress` as fallback when `scrapedAddress` is null
- Both paste button and global paste listener updated

**5. Updated smart geocoding (src/lib/geocoding.ts)**
- When no coordinates available, forward geocode the ADDRESS (not just name)
- Priority: scraped/URL address > place name
- "58 Chadwick Rd, London SE15 4PU" → forward geocode → London coords

#### Test Results (Debug Script Verified)
- **Android URL**: name="The Gluten Free Bakery", address="58 Chadwick Rd, London SE15 4PU" ✅
  - No coords in URL, will forward geocode address to get London location
- **Desktop URL**: coords=51.46°N, 0.07°W (London) ✅, name="The Gluten Free Bakery" ✅
  - Has correct coordinates, address can use forward geocoding as fallback

#### Files Modified:
- src/lib/maps.ts - Added extractPlaceInfoFromUrl(), improved coordinate extraction
- src/lib/google-maps-scraper.ts - Consent URL extraction, improved consent handling
- src/app/actions/urls.ts - urlExtractedAddress field, URL extraction fallback
- src/components/Layout.tsx - Use urlExtractedAddress fallback
- src/app/share/page.tsx - Use urlExtractedAddress fallback
- src/lib/geocoding.ts - Geocode address when no coordinates

#### Verification:
- Build passes successfully
- Debug script confirms correct extraction from both test URLs
