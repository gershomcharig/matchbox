## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-21
**Current Phase**: Phase 0 Complete, Ready for Phase 1
**Next Step**: Phase 1.1 - Mapbox Setup

---

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Project Setup (COMPLETE)
- [x] 0.1 Initialize Next.js with App Router (commit: 1b205b7)
- [x] 0.2 Tailwind CSS configured and tested
- [x] 0.3 Environment & Git setup (.env.local.example created)
- [x] 0.4 Project structure created (components/, lib/, app/)
- [x] 0.5 Supabase client setup (lib/supabase.ts) (commit: 05922ea)
- [x] 0.6-0.9 Database schema created:
  - settings table (key, value)
  - collections table (id, name, color, icon, timestamps)
  - places table (id, collection_id, name, address, lat, lng, google_maps_url, rating, opening_hours, website, phone, notes, timestamps, deleted_at)
  - tags table (id, name)
  - place_tags junction table (place_id, tag_id)

---

## Decisions Made

### Database
- Using Supabase (PostgreSQL) with free tier
- All tables created via Supabase dashboard/SQL editor
- Foreign key from places.collection_id → collections.id
- Soft delete via deleted_at timestamp on places

### Project Structure
- /app - Next.js App Router pages
- /components - React components
- /lib - Utility functions (supabase.ts, etc.)
- /docs - Documentation (roadmap.md, PRD.md, progress.txt)

## Blockers Encountered

(None yet - document any blockers here with attempted solutions)

## Failed Approaches

(Document approaches that didn't work to avoid repeating them)

Example format:
```
### [Date] - [What was attempted]
**Problem**: Description of what went wrong
**Why it failed**: Root cause analysis
**Better approach**: What to do instead
```
