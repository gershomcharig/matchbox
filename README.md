# Matchbox

A personal place-saving app that makes it effortless to collect and organize locations you want to visit.

## How it works

Paste a Google Maps link (or share it directly from the Google Maps app on Android) and Matchbox automatically extracts the place details—name, address, rating, hours, and more. No typing, no forms, just paste and save.

## Features

- **Effortless saving** — Paste links or share from Google Maps to instantly save places
- **Smart organization** — Group places into customizable collections with colored pins and icons
- **Flexible browsing** — View places on a map or as a list, filter by collection or tags, search across everything
- **Travel-ready** — Mobile-first PWA that works great on your phone while exploring a new city
- **Your data, your way** — Export to JSON or CSV for backup or further use
